# About

This fork of the corporate design beamer template is intended to be XeLaTex (and possibly LuaLaTex) compatible.
The packages `inputenc` and `fontenc` are not required anymore.

Further this fork does not require the `cabin` package to be available but ships a folder containing the opentype font files.
These are defined as the standard sans font using `fontspec`.
